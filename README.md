# Linaro Certificate Authority

A basic, proof-of-concept certificate authority (CA) and utility written in Go.

This utility can be used to validate and sign certificate signing requests (CSRs),
list previously registered devices, and enables a basic HTTP server that can be
used to communicate with the CA and it's underlying device registry.
