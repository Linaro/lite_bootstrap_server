# Linaro Certificate Authority

A basic, proof-of-concept certificate authority (CA) and utility written in Go.

This utility can be used to validate and sign certificate signing requests
(CSRs), list previously registered devices, and enables a basic HTTP server
and REST API that can be used to communicate with the CA and it's underlying
device registry.

Certificate requests are logged to a local SQLite database (`CADB.db`), which
can be used to extend the utility for blocklist/allowlist type features,
and certificate status checks based on the registered device's unique ID.

## Quick Setup

### Setup Script

A bash script named `setup.sh`, in the root of this repo, can be used to
generate the HTTP and CA keys and certificates, and start the server. The
steps included in this script are detailed below.

### Building `linaroca`

`linaroca` can be built with the following command:

```bash
$ go build
```

Supported commands and flags are visible via `--help`:

```bash
$ ./linaroca --help
A proof-of-concept certificate authority (CA) and management tool.

Usage:
  linaroca [command]

Available Commands:
  cakey       CA key management
  help        Help about any command
  server      HTTPS server management

Flags:
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.linaroca.yaml)
  -h, --help            help for linaroca
  -t, --toggle          Help message for toggle

Use "linaroca [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Key Generation for HTTP Server

The HTTP server requires a private key for TLS, which can be generated via:

```bash
$ openssl ecparam -name secp256r1 -genkey -out SERVER.key
```

You can then generate a self-signed X.509 certificate, containing the public
key via:

```bash
$ openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -days 3650 -key SERVER.key -out SERVER.crt \
        -subj "/O=Linaro, LTD/CN=localhost"
```

This certificate should be available on any device(s) connecting to the HTTPS
server to verify that we are communicating with the intended CA.

The contents of the certificate can be displayed via:

```bash
$ openssl x509 -in SERVER.crt -noout -text
```

### Key Generation for Certificate Authority

The certificate authority also requires a key to sign certificates, which can
be generated by the app:

```bash
$ ./linaroca cakey generate
generate called
use cafile: CA.crt
```

> **NOTE**: Certain values are hard-coded in `linaroca` when generating the
  CA certificate. This utility may be extended to expose those values in the
  future, but at the moment the hard-coded values are sufficient for the
  proof-of-concept nature of this app.

### Starting the CA Server

To initialise the HTTP server with TLS on the default port (1443), run:

> :information_source: Use the `-p <port>` flag to change the port number.

```bash
$ ./linaroca server start
Starting CA server on port https://localhost:1443
Starting mTLS TCP server on port https://localhost:8443
```

This will serve web pages from root, and handle REST API requests from the
`/api/v1` sub-path, with page routing handled in `httpserver.go`.

> Note: A secondary TCP server is started at the same time to test mutual TLS
  (mTLS) connections. This can be ignored at this point.

## REST API Endpoints

The REST API is a **work in progress**, and not fully implemented at present!

API based loosely on [CMP (RFC4210)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4210).

### `/api/v1/cr` Certification Request from JSON: **POST**

This endpoint is used to request a certificate for a new device, providing a
**BASE64-encoded CSR payload in a JSON wrapper** with the following format:

> You can generate the expected JSON payload from a CSR file via the
  `make_csr_json.go` helper described elsewhere in this document.

```json
{
  "CSR":"MIH9MIGlAgEAMEMxEjAQBgNVBAoMCWxvY2FsaG9zdDEtMCsGA1UEAwwkZThjNDdiNDItZjdmYy00ZGM4LWI1MzgtOTM0OTZiNjE5YTNjMFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEJ5aLGLJID8MVHCHEzQOlO63RvBaTy8lRbtkDODYPgDKBOuAHWXbytgjO32K8O282BK/Hl5eEKqcXcHerlxE2xKAAMAoGCCqGSM49BAMCA0cAMEQCIEFoH+NV9jXJA0PmctbCQ7FOBnE/aT9hmqBuvBq2kIhuAiAyKGAUIAzHDBZ+lY6WaJGh/56rzr4KprVtNYFGLHLs1g=="
}
```

> :warning: The `CSR` field in the JSON payload is the BASE64 encoded byte
  array from the equivalent of a DER file, and doesn't include the text
  headers present in the PEM file generated by
  `openssl req -new -key USER.key -out USER.csr` lower in this guide.
  `make_csr_json.go` takes care of the process of loading the human-readable
  PEM file, extracting the byte array for the CSR, and encoding the payload
  in the expected format, seen below.

The CA will assign and record a unique serial number for this certificate,
which can later be used to check the certificate status via the `cs/{serial}`
endpoint.

It will reply with a JSON array containing `Status` and `Cert` fields,
where `Cert` contains the BASE64-encoded certificate:

```json
{
  "Status":0,
  "Cert":"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"
}
```

### `/api/v1/p10cr` Certification Request from PKCS10: **POST**

This endpoint is used to request a certificate for a new device, posting a
PKCS#10 CSR file in **PEM format** (ex. `USER.csr` generated lower in this
guide) as part of the request.

The CA will assign and record a unique serial number for this certificate,
which can later be used to check the certificate status via the `cs/{serial}`
endpoint.

It will reply with a certificate file in PEM format or a status error in JSON,
depending on the input CSR provided.

Testing this endpoint with:

```bash
$ curl -v --cacert SERVER.crt \
  -F csrfile=@USER.csr \
  --output USER.crt \
  https://localhost:1443/api/v1/p10cr
```

should give you a `USER.crt` file in **PEM format**, which you can view via:

```bash
$ openssl x509 -in USER.crt -noout -text
```

### `api/v1/cs/{serial}` Certificate Status Request: **GET**

Requests the certificate status based on the supplied certificate serial number.

The serial number is generated by the CA during the certificate generation
process (`/ap1/v1/cr`), and is a unique timestamp-based 64-bit integer (ex. 
`1635511354607407000`) that is added to the certificate before sending it back
to the requesting device.

It can be retrieved from a certificate via the serial number field, for
example:

```bash
$ openssl x509 -in USER.crt -noout -text
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 1635511354607407000 (0x16b280e9657e0f98)
        ...
```

```bash
$ curl -v --cacert SERVER.crt \
  https://localhost:1443/api/v1/cs/1635511354607407000
```

### `api/v1/kur` Key Update Request: **POST**

Request an update to an existing (non-revoked and non-expired) certificate. An
update is a replacement certificate containing either a new subject public
key or the current subject public key.

### `api/v1/krr` Key Revocation Request: **POST**

Requests the revocation of an existing certificate registration.

## Certificate Generation Workflow

The steps below can be followed to simulate a certificate request from a
hardware device.

This test scenario calls `make_csr_json.go`, which takes a certificate
signing request (CSR) file, and converts it into a JSON file that can be sent
to the CA server using the REST API. The encoded CSR file can then be sent to
the CA server using `wget`, which will return the generated certificate as
a JSON payload.

#### 1. Start `linaroca`

> **NOTE**: You first need to generate keys for the CA and HTTPS server,
  as described earlier in this readme.

```bash
$ ./linaroca server start
Starting CA server on port https://localhost:1443
Starting mTLS TCP server on localhost:8443
```

#### 2. Generate a private user key with openssl

Each device requires its own private key, which is securely held on the
embedded device, and should never be exposed. For simulation purposes, however,
we generate a user key locally with `openssl`, storing is as `USER.key`.

```bash
$ openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -out USER.key
```

#### 3. Generate a CSR based on the private user key

We can now generate a sample CSR using the private key we just saved to
`USER.key`, and a random UUID for the `CN` field.

> **IMPORTANT**: The `O` field should be set to `localhost` for local
  tests, to match the value set in the HTTP Server's `LTD/CN` field (see
  earlier in this guide). This should be changed to a different, unique value
  (`MyOrgname`, etc.) in production.

> **IMPORTANT**: The `CN` field of the certificate signing request's subject
  **MUST** be a unique identifier for the device being registered. A UUID is a
  good choice for this (using `uuidgen`, etc.).

```bash
$ openssl req -new -key USER.key -out USER.csr \
    -subj "/O=localhost/CN=$(uuidgen | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"
```

#### 4. Convert the CSR to JSON (`make_csr_json.go`)

```bash
$ go run make_csr_json.go
```

#### 5. Send `USER.json` to `api/v1/cr` using `wget`

> Note the use of the `SERVER.crt` certificate to verify that we are talking
  to the server that we believe we are communicating with.

```bash
$ wget --ca-certificate=SERVER.crt \
    --post-file USER.json \
    https://localhost:1443/api/v1/cr \
    -O USER.cr
```

This should produce the following output:

```
--2020-10-29 18:30:46--  https://localhost:1443/api/v1/cr
Resolving localhost (localhost)... ::1, 127.0.0.1

2020-10-29 18:30:46 (83.2 MB/s) - â€˜USER.crâ€™ saved [611/611]
```

#### 6. Process the JSON-encoded certificate response

If the CSR was accepted and successfully processed, the response will be a
DER formatted certificate enclosed in a JSON wrapper, with the certificate
payload BASE64 encoded in the `Cert` field:

```
{"Status":0,
"Cert":"MIIBljCCATygAwIBAgIIFjs36o603SAwCgYIKoZIzj0EAwIwOjEUMBIGA1UEChMLTGluY
XJvLCBMVEQxIjAgBgNVBAMTGUxpbmFyb0NBIFJvb3QgQ2VydCAtIDIwMjAwHhcNMjAxMDA1MjIwNj

9E3MIzZ+oP36wBKgP21ZJhEZmoVE="}
```

As a test, you can parse the JSON packet locally and convert it from BASE64
to a binary DER file via:

```bash
$ jq -r '.Cert' < USER.cr | base64 --decode > USER.der
```

You can then convert it from binary **DER** to text **PEM** format via:

```bash
$ openssl x509 -in USER.der -inform DER -out USER.crt -outform PEM
```

The certificate can then be parsed as follows:

```bash
$ openssl x509 -in USER.crt -noout -text

```

#### 7. Optional: Verify the Certificate

You can verify that the generated certificate was signed by the CA using the
`CA.crt` file generated earlier in this guide.

```bash
$ openssl verify -CAfile CA.crt USER.crt
USER.crt: OK
```

#### 8. Optional: Verify CA Database Contents

You can check the contents of the CA DB via:

```bash
$ sqlite3 CADB.db .dump
```

## Testing mutual TLS Authentication

A secondary TCP server is started up along with the main CA server to test
mutual TLS authentication using client certificates.

mutual TLS authentication requests a certificate from the connecting client
device that has been signed with the CA, adding an additional level of trust
on behalf of the server concerning the client device.

### Using a CA-signed client certificate

Once a user certificate has been generated (see steps above), you can test
mTLS connections via:

```bash
$ openssl s_client \
  -cert USER.crt -key USER.key \
  -CAfile SERVER.crt \
  -connect localhost:8443
```

- The `cert` and `key` fields indicates the client certificate and key
- The `CAfile` field is the server certificate, signed by the CA

The CA key is not added in this situation since the TCP server has a
copy of it that it uses to validate the client certificate's signature
against.

If the connection is successful, you should get the following response
at the end of the outptut:

```
Verify return code: 0 (ok)
```

And linaroca will display details about the client cert in the log output:

```bash
$ ./linaroca server start
Starting CA server on port https://localhost:1443
Starting mTLS TCP server on localhost:8443
Connection accepted from 127.0.0.1:50231
Client certificate:
- Issuer CN: LinaroCA Root Cert - 2020
- Subject: CN=e8c47b42-f7fc-4dc8-b538-93496b619a3c,O=localhost
```

### Using an invalid client certificate

To test with an **invalid user certificate**, generate a new cert:

```bash
$ openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -out USERBAD.key
$ openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -key USERBAD.key -out USERBAD.crt -subj "/O=Linaro, LTD/CN=localhost"
```

Then try the request again:

```bash
$ openssl s_client \
  -cert USERBAD.crt -key USERBAD.key \
  -CAfile SERVER.crt\
  -connect localhost:8443
```

You should get the following error from linaroca:

```
Connection accepted from 127.0.0.1:50443
Client handshake error: tls: failed to verify client certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```
